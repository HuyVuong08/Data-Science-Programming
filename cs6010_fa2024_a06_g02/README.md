## Reflection

In this assignment, I worked on various data manipulation and analysis tasks using pandas in Python. The tasks involved grouping data by specific columns (e.g: `continent` and `year`), and performing aggregate functions like `sum`, `mean`, and `median`. I also learned how to handle `datetime indices` and calculating the decade from a year. Also, I calculated the `sum` accross the columns using the `axis=1` parameter in the `sum()` function, and `sort()` the results.

Additionally, I learned how to apply lambda functions to transform data, such as capitalizing all letters in specific columns like `Mjob` and `Fjob`.

Another important aspect was handling and cleaning the data, such as removing unnecessary columns (`Population` column) and setting appropriate indices. These steps are crucial for ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of the analysis.

## Reflection Questions

**What do I believe I did well on this assignment?**

- I did well in understanding and applying various data manipulation techniques using pandas (e.g: `apply()`, `map()`, `groupby()`).
- Additionally, I used aggregate functions, and handle datetime indices effectively.

**What was the most challenging part of this assignment?**

- The most challenging part of this assignment was handling datetime indices as it was new to me.
- Calculating decades from years is also a little bit challenging.

**What would have made this assignment a better experience?**

- The assignment provides a good learning experience. All good so far.
- Probably, more complex questions and bigger/more complex dataset might make this assignment even better.

**What do I need help with?**

- I would need more help with getting familiarized with the `Datetime` library
