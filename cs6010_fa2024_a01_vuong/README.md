For newbie in the `python` language, you may find the exercises `01 - 07` very helpful in your day to day coding with `python`.

For intermediate `python` users, the most interesting part in this project is the exercise `19_recap2_exercise` where you develop a mini game in `python`.

From my experience, the most chanlenging part of this project is the `08_testing1_exercise` where I used `pytest` for the first time; however, this library is very useful when you want validate your program.

Overall, these exercises gave me an overview of what `python` is capable of and some tasks that could be easily done by `python`, for instance, unit testing.

From my industry knowledge, python are mostly used in backend development, data analyzing, data science, unit testing and sometimes full-stack web development.

### Libraries used

This project mostly covers the basic operations in `python` and ultilizes those libraries:
* `pathlib` for file I/O
* `pytest` for testing
* `datetime`, `zoneinfo`, and `pytz` for time zone conversion
